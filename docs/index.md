Pairwise testing is an effective test case generation technique that is based on the observation that most faults are caused by interactions of at most two factors. Pairwise-generated test suites cover all combinations of two therefore are much smaller than exhaustive ones yet still very effective in finding defects.

### Resources
You can read more about this technique in many [papers](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=pairwise+testing&btnG=) and [books](https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&tag=pairwise-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=d32d92503bf7cc820739af70b6913097&camp=1789&creative=9325&index=books&keywords=software%20combinatorial%20testing) published over the years.

### Tools
There are many [tools](./tools.md) that adopted and integrated pairwise testing as one of the test generation methods.
